# LED Floor
{{< figure src="./images/led_floor.jpg">}}

This is a small LED floor, with 16 panels.

* Square tiles with 48x48 LEDs, made from 4 24x24 subpanels
* DBStar XMPlayer software configures the sender/reciever modules
  * BEWARE it's very easy to break it in this software, even if you backup the config first
  * Pressing the Preview button in the software has broken the screen output for us.
* Driver chip: JXI5020GP

Resolution, details, etc TBC.

It uses a DBStar controller system, which is not the easiest to work with.
